<!-- # Step 4 - Merge the pull request

The final objective of this LAB is to publish a module so that would be ready to be consumed... But where will you publish it?

CARML (GitHub version) currently publishing on _TemplateSpec_ and _Bicep registry_. The Bicep Registry needs a globally unique name, so you will need to use a name that's different from the one cloned from the public CARML repository.

1. Go to `Code` and make sure your branch is selected
1. Navigate to `.github/variables/global.variables.json` and click edit.
1. Find the `bicepRegistryName` variable and modify its value. Use a name that will likely be available.
1. Commit the change.

Now we can merge the pull request and publish the module at last!

1. Go to `Pull request` and select the pull request you previously created.
1. Navigate to the bottom of the page and push the `Merge pull request` button and confirm. You can also delete the branch, we won't use it anymore.

1. Now go back to `Actions`. You will see the merge triggered a workflow run.

# Step 5 - Verify publishing results

You can now check the results of the full workflow run.

1. If you're not there, go to `Actions`. The last workflow run should be the one triggered by the merge. You can see the results, and the where the publishing job was correctly run.
1. You can see the details by clicking on the `Publish module` job.

1. You can also navigate to the azure portal and see the newly created `artifacts-rg` resource group. You will see a container registry and a template spec.

1. If you select the azure container registry, you can verify the module was also published there.
