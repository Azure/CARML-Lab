In this lab, you will learn how to use the modules that are currently available in the CARML library to build a basic, template-orchestrated solution.

# Step 1 - Download the code base

So start building a solution / workload, you first have to get access to the code base. One of the ways to do so is to follow the following sequence of steps:

1. Open to the repository via the URL [aka.ms/CARML](https://aka.ms/CARML)

2. On the overview page, select the `<> Code` button to the right, and select the `Download ZIP` button in the opening pop up to trigger the repository to be downloaded as a compressed file.

# Step 2 - Create solution file

# Step 3 - Build solution

- Setup simple solution with local paths (e.g. RG + VNET + NSG + â€¦) that can be changed later to ACR paths

# Step 4 - Stretch goal: Deploy solution
