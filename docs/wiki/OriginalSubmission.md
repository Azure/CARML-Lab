# Spark Proposal (Spark Proposal.docx)

## Title _(111-ish characters)_
_Use CARML to develop and deploy a workload solution in a CAF Azure Landing Zone with Bicep & GitHub_

## Objective _(4000 characters)_
_Learn how to use the open-source Common-Azure-Resource-Modules-Library (CARML) to develop and deploy workload solution. You will fork and configure the CARML project (https://github.com/Azure/ResourceModules), then develop and deploy a workload using it. You will also learn about the tools used to help with contributing. Learn how CARML can help you achieve LED/MISDA Principle 2 - Start Fast, Deploy for Use, and Iterate Quickly; Principle 4 - Seek Data-Driven Continuous Improvement; and Principle 5 - Secure and Quality by Design._

## Abstract _(4000 characters)_
_In this session, we will apply CARML concepts using the deploy and manage workload scenario: from basic template development to its release and consumption. After a brief overview, we will continue with the hands-on experience by forking & configuring CARML, operating it, and using its published building blocks to create and deploy a solution from it. To wrap things up, we will then show you the different utilities that come with the platform, and how to use them to contribute to the library itself._
_https://aka.ms/CARML originated from https://aka.ms/IACS and our collective experiences engaging with ACF, CCOE, AMO customers over the last 2 years._
